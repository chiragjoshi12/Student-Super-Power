Dear Chirag, on achieving a 20% Learning Score, it is clear that you have a basic understanding of the principle of conservation of mass, but there are areas that we need to work on. Here's a detailed roadmap for you:

**Week 1-2:** Begin with a brief review of the foundation i.e., the law of conservation of mass. You have already showed your understanding on this topic.
* Resource: [Khan Academy- Law of Conservation of Mass](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/chemical-reactions-stoichiome)

**Week 3-4:** Once the basics are reviewed, we will start focusing on balancing chemical equations as this is an area that needs improvement. 
* Day 1-5: Understand the need for the balanced chemical equations. You can make use of this article: [Why do we balance chemical equations?](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Book%3A_Introductory_Chemistry_(CK-12)/07%3A_Chemical_Reactions/7.05%3A_Balancing_Chemical_Equations)
* Day 6-10: Understand about reactant and product in a chemical equations. Resource: [What are reactants and products in a chemical reaction?](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/chemical-reactions-stoichiome/balancing-chemical-equations/v/balancing-chemical-equation)
* Day 11-14: Practice balancing chemical equations using numerous examples and practice problems available on the internet. Resource: [Balancing Equations Practice](https://www.quia.com/jg/66067list.html)
 
**Week 5-6:** Study the different types of chemical reactions - (combination, decomposition, single and double displacement). 
* Resource: [Types of Chemical Reactions](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/chemical-reactions-stoichiome/types-of-chemical-reactions/v/introduction-to-oxidation-reduction-redox-reactions)

Remember, you need to go through these resources slowly, ensure understanding, and try solving the exercises they provide. You are also encouraged to raise queries and discuss your understanding with your peers or mentors. 

You will be tested on your understanding at the end of each week. This roadmap will provide you a progressive path to improve and understand chemical equations better. Try to remain consistent and committed, and you'll become proficient at balancing chemical equations. Good luck!
