## **Project Architecture**

**AI Agents** orchestrated by Crew AI:

1. **To-Know Agent:** Gathers student learning styles, preferences, strengths, and interests to create a detailed student profile.
2. **Learning Tracker Agent:** Tracks understanding via quizzes, establishing a Learning Score (LS).
3. **Roadmap Agent:** Develops a personalized learning map with resources.
4. **Tutor Agent:** Provides guidance based on the learning roadmap.
5. **Practice Agent:** Supplies practice tasks, updates LS, and tracks learning progress.

## **Installation and Setup**
